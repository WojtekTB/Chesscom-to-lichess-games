**Q: Can you run this on Microsoft Edge?**  
A: Yes, the method described [here](#chrome) works as intended.

**Q: Does this help someone cheat?**  
A: No, you can only import and analyse finished games.

**Q: Why not just play on Lichess.org? What is the point of playing on chess.com if you will just import all the games?**  
A: I just prefer to play on chess.com. I do also play on Lichess.org but chess.com is my main account.
Since I still mostly use the Lichess tools,
it is more convenient for me and people in a similar situation to just quickly import games to Lichess instead.

**Q: Will this get me banned?**  
A: No, it will not.

**Q: Isn't it unethical to use Lichess' computer analysis if you do not play there?**  
A: While I understand the concern, Lichess chooses to allow users to import their games in any amount and to provide computer analysis.
In fact, to prevent people from abusing this they actually limit this to 35 game analysis a day per user.
I do not think this is a major problem for Lichess; however, if you find that this tool is unethical by your standards,
I understand and you are more than welcome to not use it.

**Q: I want to participate! How do I add my code to the extensions?**  
A: Make a pull request with your code! I will review it and if it is good I will push it to main!

**Q: Does this work for other chess variants such as "Atomic Chess"?**  
A: Yes! This should work as long as both websites support your chess variant.
